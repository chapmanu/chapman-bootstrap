# Chapman Bootstrap

**Chapman Bootstrap** is a theme for third-party Chapman websites.

## Installation

Copy and paste the following HTML tags into the `<head>` of your page.

```html
<link href="//www.chapman.edu/_bootstrap/1.1.1" rel="theme">
<link href="//www.chapman.edu/_bootstrap/style.css" rel="stylesheet">
<script src="//www.chapman.edu/_bootstrap/script.js"></script>
```

Then, copy and paste the following HTML tags into the `<head>` of your page, but only if they are not already there.

```html
<meta charset="utf-8">
<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1">
```

Finally, choose a two-column or three-column layout by clicking one of the links below. Copy and paste its HTML into the `<body>` of your page.

[Two-column layout with side navigation](template/2col-sidenav.html).

[Three-column layout with side navigation](template/3col-sidenav.html).

Congratulations! You should now see the Chapman Bootstrap theme. Follow the [instructions in the template](template/2col-sidenav.html#L126-L134) to replace the placeholder content with your own.
